
This directory contains a self explanatory FORTRAN program ra_files.for
to convert the ascii data contained in subdirectory ./ascii into two
random access files suitable for reading by routines in the gamma_n library.

This program will possibly need compiling and running if the computer you
are using is different from a PC running Microsoft FORTRAN. A sample program
cprog.bat for compiling is included.
